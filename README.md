#PROBLEM STATEMENT
Prepare and encode biological sequence data as frequency vectors; apply an
unsupervised learning algorithm (KMeans) and determine the optimal number of clusters.

#Overview
First, we talk about the key steps for encoding the biological sequence data which is later followed by a brief discussion on the results
obtained by application of KMeans algorithm in the second part.
